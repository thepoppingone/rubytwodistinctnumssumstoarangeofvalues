A good algorithm challenge that uses both a binary tree search and log n one head one tail double iteration 

An input file contains integers, both positive and negative (there might be some duplicates). Each line on the file has one integer.
Compute the number of distinct y values within the range -10000 ≤ y ≤ 10000 such that there are distinct numbers a, b in the file where a + b = y.
